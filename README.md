# oop_with_ruby_project

Two command line games built on Ruby:

- Tic-Tac-Toe with IA that plays really well
- Mastermind without IA.

From what I remember (I built them 6 months ago), both of the games have bugs.

Part of the curriculum of The Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop?ref=lc-pb)

Update 13/05/2016 - I only really got OOP recently so this is probably pretty bad. :P
